The back-end is built used flask, python, and SQLAlchemy, with a database hosted remotely on Azure SQL. 

The current backend consists of two files, "app.py" and "models.py". 


Models.py:
This file stores the ORM models that we use for creating objects from the database.  


App.py:
This file creates the flask application, and the SQLalchemy database object. It also is where API call functions are located. Currently we have API calls that can do the following:

/api/getUsers - this is a get request that returns users with the given parameters:

phonenumber
username
password
year of study


/api/addUsers
